Did you find these tutorials difficult or easy to get through? In particular, what is your personal experience and comfort level with using computers and the internet, and how do you think this affects your experience going through these tutorials and getting set up with class this week?



I found this easy, simply follow the instructions, i am fairly well versed in this matter therefore i accomplished this without trouble.



If you had an easy time with the assignments this week, reflect on how this experience might be more difficult for somebody who does NOT have an easy time using a computer. What resources do you think somebody who is less experienced with computers needs to be able to complete assignments like these? Do you think that relates to how somebody who's trying to play a video game may have difficulty with installing and running the game?



It may be more difficult or annoying for those without more ram, decent wifi, Baseline CPU, it would be too slow to be fun and fall into a waiting game, With the internet they can simply look up information they dont have themselves, although in person assistance might be needed for those truly foreign to computers,

Those who dont know much will have a harder time than those who do, They would likely struggle looking for the install or a reputable source, running the game might be difficult depending on how the file appears, if it doesnt appear on the desktop it would probably take them a little minute or two.
